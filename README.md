# My-Teachnook-Project-summer-intern-2022-
This is my first internship (online) experience. This helped me to implement what I have learned from the course that IIT Bhubaneswar had provided me. In this internship my project was to take a Dataset, to perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and to apply a suitable Classifier, Regressor and Clusterer and to calculate the accuracy of the model.
